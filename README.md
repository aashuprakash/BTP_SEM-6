omkar bhaiya meet on 23/02 discussed about Single Cell RNA Seq Datasets and then performing DGA.
mid sems
4/03 meet 2 omkar bhaiya verifing of the single cell "" and proceeding with pipeling
08/03 Online meet with ma'am
09/03 offline meet wiht both PHD change of work flow again first generating of the count from raw data and various processes and DGA planing and working on FASTQC and matching of the genes and pathways shared.
error we encountered of java instalation for Fastqc on server root acess denied sudo .


 #https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE225605 #Paired_ayush contains the paired and unpaired FASTQ files of the paired file.


After assigning of PHD we are in regular touch with the Co author and working in RND on daily basis in cordination with her.


we faced problems in between 
-
downloading things 
changing things 
introduction of new things in between GTF files , etc.
Now upon trying a lot many times of the o outcome on files mainly on trimming .
Non availability of the SRA accesion id's.
We tried every possible method as discussed with ma'am and we find that the dataset has some error due which we are not getting desired results.
